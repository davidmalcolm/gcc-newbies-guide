Debugging GCC
=============

The ``gcc`` binary is actually a relatively small "driver" program, which
parses some command-line options, and then invokes one or more other
programs to do the real work.

Consider compiling a simple hello world C program:

.. literalinclude:: hello.c
   :language: c

to generate an ``a.out`` binary:

.. code-block:: console

  $ gcc hello.c
  $ ./a.out
  Hello world

Internally, the driver will invoke ``cc1`` (the C compiler), which
converts the .c code to a .s assembler file.  Assuming this succeeds the
driver will typically then invoke ``as`` (the assembler), then the linker.

Given that, how do we debug the C compiler?   The easier way is to add
``-wrapper gdb,--args`` to the `gcc` command-line:

.. code-block:: console

  # Invoke "cc1" (and "as", etc) under gdb:
  $ gcc hello.c -wrapper gdb,--args

The ``gcc`` driver will then invoke ``cc1`` under ``gdb``, and you can
set breakpoints, and step through the code.

.. note::

   If you ever need to debug the driver itself, you can simply run it under
   gdb in the normal way:

   .. code-block:: console

     # Invoke the "gcc" driver under gdb:
     $ gdb --args gcc hello.c

  I find myself doing this much less frequently than the
  ``-wrapper gdb,--args`` invocation for debugging ``cc1`` though.

  .. _valgrind:

You can invoke other debugging programs this way, for example, valgrind:

.. code-block:: console

  # Invoke "cc1" (and "as", etc) under valgrind:
  $ gcc hello.c -wrapper valgrind

.. note::

  For good results under valgrind, it's best to configure your build
  of gcc with :option:`--enable-valgrind-annotations`, which automatically
  suppresses various known false positives.

Support scripts for ``gdb``
---------------------------

The source tree contains two support scripts that significantly improve
the debugging experience within ``gdb``, but some setup is required.

``gcc/configure`` (from ``configure.ac``) automatically generates a
``.gdbinit`` within the ``gcc`` subdirectory of the build directory,
and when run by ``gdb``.

This should be automatically detected and run by gdb.  However, you may see
a message from gdb of the form::

  "path-to-build/gcc/.gdbinit" auto-loading has been declined by your `auto-load safe-path'

as a protection against untrustworthy python scripts.  See
  http://sourceware.org/gdb/onlinedocs/gdb/Auto_002dloading-safe-path.html

The fix is to mark the paths of the ``build/gcc`` directory as trustworthy.
An easy way to do so is by adding the following to your ``~/.gdbinit`` script::

  add-auto-load-safe-path /absolute/path/to/build/gcc

for the build directories for your various checkouts of gcc.

If it's working, you should see the message::

  Successfully loaded GDB hooks for GCC

as gdb starts up.

The generated ``.gdbinit`` script loads two files:

(a) `gcc/gdbinit.in <https://gcc.gnu.org/git/?p=gcc.git;a=blob;f=gcc/gdbinit.in>`_
    contains useful commands in ``gdb``'s own language, sets up
    useful breakpoints, and skipping of some very heavily-used inline
    functions.

(b) `gcc/gdbhooks.py <https://gcc.gnu.org/git/?p=gcc.git;a=blob;f=gcc/gdbhooks.py>`_
    injects useful Python code into gdb, for pretty-printing important
    data types.

See the links above for more information.


Why can't I find option-related variables in the debugger?
----------------------------------------------------------

Consider this line of code:

.. code-block:: c++

  return optimize > 0 && flag_forward_propagate;

It might be reasonable to presume that these are variables that can be
inspected in the debugger, but, despite the lack of block capitals,
they're actually macros, and hence the "obvious" approach fails::

  (gdb) print optimize
  No symbol "optimize" in current context.
  (gdb) print flag_forward_propagate
  No symbol "flag_forward_propagate" in current context.

They're autogenerated preprocessor macros: during the build,
``BUILDDIR/gcc/options.h`` is written out, and contains code like this:

.. code-block:: c++

  #ifdef GENERATOR_FILE
  extern int optimize;
  #else
    int x_optimize;
  #define optimize global_options.x_optimize
  #endif

and:

.. code-block:: c++

  #ifdef GENERATOR_FILE
  extern int flag_forward_propagate;
  #else
    int x_flag_forward_propagate;
  #define flag_forward_propagate global_options.x_flag_forward_propagate
  #endif

Hence they're only variables when ``GENERATOR_FILE`` is defined (when
building certain build-time support files); for the common case of
the compiler and driver, these are actually fields within the
``global_options`` struct, with a ``x_`` prefix.

Hence to read these values when debugging you would use the following::

  (gdb) print global_options.x_optimize
  $1 = 3
  (gdb) print global_options.x_flag_forward_propagate
  $2 = 1

reflecting that, in this case, :option:`-O3` was supplied on the
command-line, and that it implicitly enabled :option:`-fforward-propagate`.
