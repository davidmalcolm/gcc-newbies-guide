Inside :program:`cc1`
---------------------

GCC is a collection of compilers for different languages, which
can generate code for a wide variety of different CPU architectures.

GCC currently supports 10 source languages, and 55 target CPU
architectures.  We don't want to have to write 550 different compilers,
so, as is common, GCC is structured into three parts:

* source language "front ends" - one for each source language, taking
  the source language as input, using it to generating an "intermediate
  represention" (IR) of the user's code in a language-independent
  internal format

* target-specific "back ends" - one for each target, taking the intermediate
  representation as input, and generating assembler for that target

* the so-called "middle end", sitting between these, which optimizes the
  code, so that the back end has better code to work with

So :program:`cc1` built for ``x86_64`` has the C frontend, the shared
optimizing code, and the x86_64 backend::

                  +-----+
                +-| cc1 |--------------------------------------------------+
                | +-----+                                                  |
                |                                                          |
                |  C frontend          Optimizer          x86_64 backend   |
   C source ====+==============>  IR =============> IR  ===================+==> x86_64 asm
                |                                                          |
                +----------------------------------------------------------+

Sadly the above picture is an idealized picture, in that the code is
rather messier than that in practice.  It's also over-simplified, in
that GCC actually has several intermediate representations, which we'll talk
about in detail below.

* if you're interested in adding new warnings to GCC, you'll probably
  want to just look at the frontends for now, and to merely skim the
  sections below.

* if you want to make GCC generate better code, you'll want to look at
  the middle-end and backends, and find out more about gcc's intermediate
  representations by reading the section below

* if you're interested in adding support to GCC for a new kind of CPU,
  you'll want to look mostly at the backend/RTL sections below


How does :program:`cc1` turn C into assembler?
**********************************************

When figuring out how the compiler works, it's best to start with a really
simple source file - in particular, one with doesn't ``#include`` any
header files.  Our earlier example used :file:`<stdio.h>`, so let's make
an even simpler :file:`test.c`:

.. code-block:: c

  int test (int a, int b, int c, int d)
  {
    if (a)
      return (b - c) * d;
    else
      return (c - b) * d;
  }

Compiling it to assembler, with some optimization (:option:`-O2`) and
enabling verbose assembler output (:option:`-fverbose-asm`):

.. code-block:: sh

  $ gcc -S test.c -O2 -fverbose-asm

gives this :file:`test.s`:

.. code-block:: asm

          .file   "test.c"
          ; ...omitting dump of options for brevity...
          .text
          .p2align 4
          .globl  test
          .type   test, @function
  test:
  .LFB0:
          .cfi_startproc
  # test.c:2: {
          movl    %ecx, %eax      # tmp97, d
  # test.c:3:   if (a)
          testl   %edi, %edi      # tmp94
          je      .L2     #,
  # test.c:4:     return (b - c) * d;
        subl    %edx, %esi      # c, tmp89
  # test.c:4:     return (b - c) * d;
          imull   %esi, %eax      # tmp89, <retval>
          ret     
          .p2align 4,,10
          .p2align 3
  .L2:
  # test.c:6:     return (c - b) * d;
          subl    %esi, %edx      # b, tmp90
  # test.c:6:     return (c - b) * d;
          imull   %edx, %eax      # tmp90, <retval>
  # test.c:7: }
          ret     
          .cfi_endproc
  .LFE0:
          .size   test, .-test
          .ident  "GCC: (GNU) 10.3.1 20210422 (Red Hat 10.3.1-1)"
          .section        .note.GNU-stack,"",@progbits

where :program:`cc1` has converted the C code into a pair of
subtractions (:code:`subl`), and a pair of multiplies (:code:`imull`)
that populate the ``%eax`` register, used for the return value.

You can see GCC's intermediate representations using GCC's dump options.  If
we add :option:`-fdump-tree-all -fdump-ipa-all -fdump-rtl-all` to the
above command line, giving:

.. code-block:: sh

  gcc -S test.c -O2 -fverbose-asm -fdump-tree-all -fdump-ipa-all -fdump-rtl-all

then these dump options lead :program:`cc1` to emit *many* dump files
(192 in the following example):

.. code-block:: sh

  test.c.100t.objsz2                  test.c.237r.expand

You'll see that they're of the form :file:`test.c.` followed by a
3 digit number, followed by "t", "i", or "r", then a suffix.

The precise numbering and suffixes of dump files varies from release to
release of GCC, and the subset that gets emitted will vary depending on
the optimization option you choose - there were 192 in the above example
(GCC 10, with :option:`-O2`).

The dump files show the state of GCC's intermediate representation of the
code at each "optimization pass".  The numbering roughly corresponds to a
time-ordering of the states within the compiler, so that e.g.
:file:`test.c.004t.original` shows the initial state of the IR coming
out of the C frontend, whilst :file:`test.c.320r.final` shows the
final state as assembler is written out.  Beware, though that the "i"
dumps are numbered out-of-order relative to the other "t" and "r" passes.

At a high level, :program:`cc1` works as follows.


Lexing
******

First the input source is "tokenized", so that the stream of input
characters is divided into a stream of tokens.  This is called "lexing",
and largely implemented in gcc in
`libcpp <https://gcc.gnu.org/git/?p=gcc.git;a=tree;f=libcpp>`_
(which also implements the preprocessor - hence the name) so that e.g.
we go from the sequence of characters:

.. code-block:: none

    return (b - c) * d;

to the sequence of tokens:

  .. code-block:: none

   CPP_KEYWORD(RID_RETURN)
   CPP_OPEN_PAREN
   CPP_NAME("b")
   CPP_MINUS
   CPP_NAME("c")
   CPP_CLOSE_PAREN
   CPP_MULT
   CPP_NAME("d")
   CPP_SEMICOLON

annotated with information about where in the user's source they
occurred.


Parsing and the :c:type:`tree` type
***********************************

Next the frontend parses the tokens from a flat stream into a tree-like
structure reflecting the grammar of the language (or complains about
syntax errors or type errors, and bails out).  Most warnings are
implemented here, so if you're interested in adding new warnings, this
is the place to look.  This stage uses gcc's :c:type:`tree` type.
There may be frontend-specific kinds of node, in the tree but the
frontend will convert these to a generic form,
so that after each frontend the middle end "sees" a tree
representation that we call
`generic <https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gccint/GENERIC.html>`_
(unless the frontend gave up due to a sufficiently serious error in the
user's code).

You can see the "generic" representation in the
:file:`test.c.004t.original` dump:

.. code-block:: c
  
    ;; Function test (null)
    ;; enabled by -tree-original
    
    
    {
      if (a != 0)
        {
          return (b - c) * d;
        }
      else
        {
          return (c - b) * d;
        }
    }

In this example, the dump of the tree IR closely resembles the
original C code, but sometimes you will see control flow expressed
via "goto" statements that go to numbered labels, and temporary
variables introduced by the frontend.

If we're running under the debugger (see :ref:`debugging`), we can see
the tree for a function body like this::

  (gdb) call debug_tree(fndecl->function_decl.saved_tree)
   <bind_expr 0x7fffea3f6240

    * each `return_expr` is one of the two return expressions

  * `parm_decl` is a parameter declaration (such as ``a``)

  * `integer_cst` is an integer constant (as opposed to a cast), such as ``0``


gimple
******

The tree-based IR can contain arbitrarily-complicated nested
expressions, which is relatively easy for the frontends to generate, but
difficult for the optimizer to work with, so GCC almost immediately converts
it into a form named "gimple", in which compound expressions such as:

.. code-block:: c

    (b - c) * d

get flattened into a series of assignments to temporary variables.  We
can see the initial form of the gimple in the :file:`test.c.005t.gimple`
dump:

.. code-block:: c

  test (int a, int b, int c, int d)
  {
    int D.1938;
  
    if (a != 0) goto <D.1936>; else goto <D.1937>;
    <D.1936>:
    _1 = b - c;
    D.1938 = d * _1;
    // predicted unlikely by early return (on trees) predictor.
    return D.1938;
    <D.1937>:
    _2 = c - b;
    D.1938 = d * _2;
    // predicted unlikely by early return (on trees) predictor.
    return D.1938;
  }

Note how the if/else control flow has become "goto" statements, and how
the "gimplifier" has flattened:

.. code-block:: c

  (b - c) * d

into assignments to two temporaries (named ``_1`` and ``D.1938``):

.. code-block:: c

    _1 = b - c;
    D.1938 = d * _1;

This gives us a sequence of gimple statements, some of which are labels,
and some of which ``goto`` those labels.

The official documentation on gimple is
`here <https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gccint/GIMPLE.html>`_.


gimple with a CFG
*****************

Although some optimization passes do work on this "gimple with labels"
representation, it is almost immediately converted to a Control Flow
Graph (CFG), a directed graph of "basic blocks" - sequences of
statements with no control flow, where the control flow is expressed
as the edges between the basic blocks.  This can be seen in the
:file:`test.c.013t.cfg` dump:

.. code-block:: c

  ;; Function test (test, funcdef_no=0, decl_uid=1933, cgraph_uid=1, symbol_order=0)
  
  ;; 1 loops found
  ;;
  ;; Loop 0
  ;;  header 0, latch 1
  ;;  depth 0, outer -1
  ;;  nodes: 0 1 2 3 4 5
  ;; 2 succs { 3 4 }
  ;; 3 succs { 5 }
  ;; 4 succs { 5 }
  ;; 5 succs { 1 }
  test (int a, int b, int c, int d)
  {
    int D.1938;
  
    <bb 2> :
    if (a != 0)
      goto <bb 3>; [INV]
    else
      goto <bb 4>; [INV]
  
    <bb 3> :
    _1 = b - c;
    D.1938 = d * _1;
    // predicted unlikely by early return (on trees) predictor.
    goto <bb 5>; [INV]
  
    <bb 4> :
    _2 = c - b;
    D.1938 = d * _2;
    // predicted unlikely by early return (on trees) predictor.
  
    <bb 5> :
    return D.1938;
  
  }
  
You can see the basic blocks via e.g. the ``<bb 2>`` headers.
There is also now a single ``return`` statement from the function; the
multiple ``return`` statements are now all expressed by assigning to a
temporary (``D.1938``), and then a ``goto`` to the basic block
containing the return statement.

If you add the ``-graph`` suffix to the ``dump`` command line options:

.. code-block:: sh

  $ gcc -S test.c -O2 -fverbose-asm \
    -fdump-tree-all-graph -fdump-ipa-all-graph -fdump-rtl-all-graph

then in addition to the dump files listed above, :program:`cc1` will
also generate :file:`.dot` files, suitable for use with GraphViz.

My favorite :file:`.dot` file viewer is
`xdot <https://github.com/jrfonseca/xdot.py>`_, which shows
:file:`test.c.013t.cfg.dot` as follows:

.. image:: images/test.c.013t.cfg.dot-in-xdot.png

which makes it easy to see the individual basic blocks, the statements
within them, and the control flow linking them.


gimple-SSA
**********

After a few more optimization passes, the gimple-cfg IR is then
converted to Static Single Assignment form (SSA).  SSA form is commonly
used inside compilers, as it makes many kinds of optimization much
easier to implement.  In SSA, every local variable is only ever assigned
to once; if there are multiple assignments to a local variable, it gets
split up into multiple versions.

In our example, you can see the SSA form of the IR in :file:`test.c.021t.ssa`:

.. code-block:: c

  ;; Function test (test, funcdef_no=0, decl_uid=1933, cgraph_uid=1, symbol_order=0)
  
  test (int a, int b, int c, int d)
  {
    int _1;
    int _2;
    int _3;
    int _8;
    int _9;
  
    <bb 2> :
    if (a_4(D) != 0)
      goto <bb 3>; [INV]
    else
      goto <bb 4>; [INV]
  
    <bb 3> :
    _1 = b_6(D) - c_5(D);
    _9 = d_7(D) * _1;
    // predicted unlikely by early return (on trees) predictor.
    goto <bb 5>; [INV]
  
    <bb 4> :
    _2 = c_5(D) - b_6(D);
    _8 = d_7(D) * _2;
    // predicted unlikely by early return (on trees) predictor.
  
    <bb 5> :
    # _3 = PHI <_9(3), _8(4)>
    return _3;
  
  }

and (in dot form) as :file:`test.c.021t.ssa.dot`:

.. image:: images/test.c.021t.ssa.dot-in-xdot.png

You can see that the single temporary ``D.1938`` from the earlier form
of the IR has been split into three separate temporaries, where the two
assignments:

.. code-block:: c

    D.1938 = d * _1;

and:

.. code-block:: c

    D.1938 = d * _2;

have now become these two assignments to separate temporaries:

.. code-block:: c

    _9 = d_7(D) * _1;

and:

.. code-block:: c

    _8 = d_7(D) * _2;

and at the point where control flow merges, we have a special construct
called a "phi node" which assigns to the new temporary ``_3`` from either
one of the ``_9`` or ``_8``, depending on whether control flow came
from block 3 or block 4:

.. code-block:: c

    # _3 = PHI <_9(3), _8(4)>

You can see that the parameters ``b`` and ``c`` from the earlier form
of the IR have also been numbered, so that the SSA form captures e.g.
that we're accessing ``b_6(D)``, meaning version 6 of parameter ``b``,
where the ``(D)`` means the initial value at the function entry: if
code wrote to one of these parameters, the SSA form would have a
different numbered version of it after the write.

The official documentation for GCC's gimple-ssa form is
`here <https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gccint/Tree-SSA.html>`_.

Once we're in gimple-SSA form, there are almost 200 optimization
passes, which can be roughly divided into:

* "intraprocedural" passes.  These work on one function at a time.
  They have a "t" code in their dump file.  For example,
  :file:`test.c.175t.switchlower` is the dump file for an optimization
  pass which converts gimple ``switch`` statements into lower-level
  gimple statements and control flow (which doesn't do anything in our
  example above, as it doesn't have any switch statements; try writing
  a simple C source file with a switch statement and see what it does)

* "interprocedural passes" which consider all of the functions at once,
  such as which functions call which other functions.  These have an
  "i" code in their dump file.  An example is :file:`test.c.080i.inline`
  though given that our example has only one function, the
  interprocedural passes won't do anything useful

The full set of optimizations passes can be see in GCC's source tree in
the file
`gcc/passes.def <https://gcc.gnu.org/git/?p=gcc.git;a=blob;f=gcc/passes.def>`_

After about 200 gimple optimizations passes, we're done with the
gimple-SSA form; its final state can be seen in :file:`test.c.235t.optimized`:

.. code-block:: c

  ;; Function test (test, funcdef_no=0, decl_uid=1933, cgraph_uid=1, symbol_order=0)
  
  test (int a, int b, int c, int d)
  {
    int _1;
    int _2;
    int _3;
    int _8;
    int _9;
  
    <bb 2> [local count: 1073741824]:
    if (a_4(D) != 0)
      goto <bb 3>; [50.00%]
    else
      goto <bb 4>; [50.00%]
  
    <bb 3> [local count: 536870913]:
    _1 = b_6(D) - c_5(D);
    _9 = _1 * d_7(D);
    goto <bb 5>; [100.00%]
  
    <bb 4> [local count: 536870913]:
    _2 = c_5(D) - b_6(D);
    _8 = _2 * d_7(D);
  
    <bb 5> [local count: 1073741824]:
    # _3 = PHI <_9(3), _8(4)>
    return _3;
  
  }

and :file:`test.c.235t.optimized.dot`:

.. image:: images/test.c.235t.optimized.dot-in-xdot.png

For our simple example, this hasn't been changed much since the initial
conversion to SSA form; it's gained some estimates about how many times
each basic block will be run (in lieu of real profiling data).


RTL
***

At this point, the gimple is converted to Register Transfer Language
(RTL), a much lower-level representation of the code, which will allow
us to eventually go all the way to assembler.  The conversion happens
in an optimization pass called "expand"; we can see the initial RTL form
of the code in the :file:`test.c.237r.expand` dump file:

The RTL form of the IR is much closer to assembler: whereas gimple works
in terms of variables of specific data types, RTL instructions work in
terms of low-level operations on an arbitrary number of registers of
specific bit sizes.

There are about 100 RTL optimization passes, which solve problems such as:

* implementing function call/return, parameter passing, and the stack of
  frames, in terms of what actually exists at the CPU level (the
  "calling conventions" of an ABI)

* using the registers actually available on the CPU, rather than
  blithely assuming that there's an arbitrary number of registers for
  every function, a process called register allocation

* using the instructions and addressing modes actually available
  on the CPU, rather than assuming an ideal set of combinations

* various optimizations, such as scheduling instructions so that they
  run efficiently on the target CPU (e.g. handling delay slots)

* converting the CFG that RTL inherited from gimple into a flat series of
  instructions connected by jumps (honoring constraints such as
  limitations on how many bytes a jump instruction can go)

The official documentation for RTL is
`here <https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gccint/RTL.html>`_.

The "final" form of RTL
***********************

Eventually the RTL form is suitable for output in assembler, in an
optimization pass called "final" (which, annoyingly, is no longer the
final pass); the :file:`test.c.320r.final` dump file looks like this:

There isn't a corresponding :file:`.dot` dump file, as by this point
the CFG has been flattened away into a stream of instructions.

There's a fairly direct correspondence between the above and the
generated assembler file, although you have to know a bit about RTL to
see it.  For example if we just look at the ``insn`` instructions, we
can see that e.g. the final multiply instruction above:

.. code-block:: lisp

  (insn:TI 19 18 26 4 (parallel [
              (set (reg:SI 0 ax [orig:84 <retval> ] [84])
                  (mult:SI (reg/v:SI 0 ax [orig:88 d ] [88])
                      (reg:SI 1 dx [90])))
              (clobber (reg:CC 17 flags))
          ]) "test.c":6:20 378 {*mulsi3_1}
       (expr_list:REG_DEAD (reg:SI 1 dx [90])
          (expr_list:REG_UNUSED (reg:CC 17 flags)
              (nil))))

i.e. "set %eax to the result of multipying %eax and %edx,
clobbering the CC register" becomes:

.. code-block:: asm

        imull   %edx, %eax      # tmp90, <retval>

in the output :file:`test.s` assembler file.
